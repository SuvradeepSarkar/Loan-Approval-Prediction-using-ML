# Loan-Approval-Prediction-using-ML
In this tutorial, we'll build a predictive model to predict if an applicant is able to repay the lending company or not. We will prepare the data using Jupyter Notebook and use various models to predict the target variable.
 Loan Distribution is the main business part of many banks. The main portion of banks
 income comes from the loan distributed to customers. These banks apply interest on
 loan which are distributed to customers. The main objective of banks is to invest
 their assets in safe customers. Up to now many banks are processing loans after
 regress process of verification and validation. But till now no bank can give surety
 that the customer who is chosen for loan application is safe or not. So to avoid this
 situation we introduced a system for the approval of bank loans known as Loan
 Prediction System Using Python. Loan Prediction System is a software which checks
 the eligibility of a particular customer who is capable of paying loan or not. This
 system checks various parameters such as customerâ€™s martial status, income,
 expenditure and various factors. This process is applied for many customers of
 trained data set. By considering these factors a required model is built. This model is
 applied on the test data set for getting required output. The output generated will
 be in the form of yes or no. Yes indicates that a particular customer is capable of
 paying loan and no indicates that the particular customer is not capable of paying
 loan. Based on these factors we can approve loans for customers.
